I break down, Only alone I will cry out loud
You'll never see what's hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah, yeah
I know I've heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I'm too afraid now, yeah, yeah

I'll put my armor on, Show you how strong I am
I'll put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yes I'll win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident
I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today [x3]
I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today [x3]
I'm unstoppable today
